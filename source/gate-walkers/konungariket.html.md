title: Gate Walkers - The Konungariket
---

The Konungariket is a forgotten empire that span dimensions through the cosmos.
Thousands of dimensions were under the influence of Konungariket. During the
reign of empire, it's population prospered, trade flourished and the arts grew.

However, as all great things must come to an end so did the Konungariket and with
it the links that held the people together around the dimensions collapsed as well.

# Flag
The royal flag of the Konungariket is a rampant lion on a field of purple, with
the outline of a archway representing the gates.

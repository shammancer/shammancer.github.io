title: Gate Walkers - Mana
---

Mana is the power to affect the world. It can be used to create, control transform
and destroy. As an entity uses mana, the entity gets attuned to the shape
that the mana takes. It becomes easier for an entity to use mana in the shapes
that it is attuned to.

Mana flows, pools and fountains within the dimensions. It is what powers the gates
and stabilizes the rifts. Mana must be channelled into the gates for it to be used.

Different types of matter have different amounts of mana capacity and conductivity.
If too much mana is stored or transferred through matter it will burn and be destroyed.

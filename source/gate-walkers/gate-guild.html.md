title: Gate Walkers - The Gate Minders
---

The gate minders are the counsciousness that maintain and grow the gate network.
Minders are known by different titles depending on the type of work they have
done on the network. Minders have normally dedicated a large portion of their
life to the network.

Gate Keeper: Maintains individual gates throughout the network ensuring continued
efficiency and functionality of the gates in their care. They might also manage a
directory of the gates connected to their own.

Gate Maker: Creates the gates. Sometimes the gates are built in place other times
not. Gate Makers ensure the efficiency of the gates they build as well as the
compatability of the gates with the rest of the network.

Gate Placer: Places gates accross the dimensions. They are normally have a method
of interdimensional travel without gates. They travel from place to place leaving
gates as they go along.

Gate Administrators: Maintains the connection between gates. They design the routes
of each gate to ensure their efficiency and speed.

Each counsciousness that works on the network leaves a signature on it.
As a result the differences they make can be traced back to them.
Signatures can be hidden, minimized, destroyed or forged 
but they always leave a trace.

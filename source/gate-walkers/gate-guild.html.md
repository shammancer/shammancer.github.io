title: Gate Walkers - The Gate Minders
---

The gate minders are the consciousness that maintain and grow the gate network.
Minders are known by different titles depending on the type of work they have
done on the network. Minders have normally dedicated a large portion of their
life to the network.

__Gate Keeper__: Maintains individual gates throughout the network ensuring
continued efficiency and functionality of the gates in their care.
They might also manage a directory of the gates connected to their own.

__Gate Maker__: Creates the gates. Sometimes the gates are built in
place other times not. Gate Makers ensure the efficiency of the gates
they build as well as the compatibility of the gates with the rest of
the network.

__Gate Placer__: Places gates across the dimensions. Gate placers travel across
the dimensions, they leave gates at places as they see fit. They often times
travel through rips however sometimes they have other methods of interdimensional
travel.

Each consciousness that works on the network leaves a signature on it.
As a result the differences they make can be traced back to them.
Signatures can be hidden, minimized, destroyed or forged
but they always leave a trace.

title: Gate Walkers - Gates

Gates are doorways between places, they connect two dimensions together or 
two places within the same dimension. They are magically complex and efficient.
Being able to tap into the gate network allows you to travel to many places.
However navigating the network is very difficult as the interconnections
between gates are very low and undocumented.

There are also rudimentary gates that exist that are not properly connected
to the gate network. As a result they might be highly inefficient or have other
defficiencies such as being unidirectional.

Some gates are natural dimensional holes or rips that are stabilized.

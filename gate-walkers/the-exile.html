        <p>Grindarnastad, once the capital of a thriving empire hundreds of years ago.
At it's height it was the centre of intercontinental trade and whispers said
even interdimensional. However in the emperors foolishness he let his domain
fall and with it the beauty that was his city.</p>

<p>As time progressed kingdoms rised and fell to replace the Konungariket. With
each fall, more and more pieces of the empire's and the city's history fell into
obscurity. Over time the truth of what Grindarnastad had been was truly lost.
It's population collapsed, the people living in the city left for greener pastures
once the trade dried up.</p>

<p>A small population remained and eventually the city grew back to a tenth of its size.
Out of the hundred thousand that now populate the city only a few thousand of them
may trace back their lineage to the original population of Grindarnastad. This small
community is held together by their religion, tradition and customs. Unfortunately,
in the last few years the majority of the city. Has been campaigning against the
minority and their religious leaders have started persecuting them as infidels.</p>

<p>During this period of strife. The scholar Bevakare Av Dorrar discovered in the old
ruins of Grindarnastad an ancient device. After years of studying old tomes of
knowledge he realized the true significance of what he had discovered. The last gate
of Grindarnastad. As the violence against his people rose in the streets Bevakare
worked at discovering how the gate worked. In time he discovered an address that the
gate could reach, he found some volunteers to go explore the other side and return
with tales of what they found on the other side. On his side, Bevakare kept the gate
open for he feared that the volunteers would be unable to return if he closed it.</p>

<p>In their journey through the gate the volunteers discovered an empty plain.
They explored a little on the plain and discovered a river flowing lazily near by.
As asked of them the volunteers took records of what they saw and they also brought
back samples of the dirt of the plains and the water of the river so that the scholar
may study them. As they stepped through the gate, the scholar took down their accounts
and grabbed the samples to study them.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks the volunteers returned to explore further around the other
side. They continued to bring back samples and while they were at it Bevakare continued
to study the gate. In his continued studies he learned that keeping the gate open for
as long as he has been, hours on end lately as the expenditions were getting longer,
causes the gate to expend quite a bit of "energy" (Bevakare was not sure of his
translation from the old tongue). The scholar feared that the gate was nearing
the end of its life unless he found a way to "charge" it. So he decided to cancel the
future expeditions until he learned more about the gate.</p>

<p>Bevakare continued his research and as he did so, so did the persecution of his people.
As the months passed, the Old Lineage started to lose hope as their situation was
growing quite bleak. Many of them asked the scholar if there was anything he could do.
Not wishing to give them false hope Bevakare spoke nothing of the gate and asked his
volunteers to do the same. Yet he still changed his area of focus and brought out the
samples returned by the volunteers. After a week of studying them and the notes of the
volunteers, Bevakare concluded that the land would be able to support his people.</p>

<p>With this knowledge he called a meeting and shared with the Old Lineage his discovery
of the gate and the land on the other side of it. He called upon the volunteers that
had travelled through the gate to also give their account. Fearing a false hope the
leaders of the Old Lineage asked to be shown the gate. He brought them to it, leaving
the volunteers to mind the crowd. Seeing the stone archway the leaders believed and
returned with the scholar to the meeting place. There they began planning the
Lineage's escape from the persecution they are suffering.</p>

<p>One week later the Old Lineage found itself standing in front of the gate. The gate
to a new life free of persecution. They had taken the week to pack all they might need
to survive on the other side. Once most of the Lineage had arrived Bevakare went to
open the gate. Yet it did not work. Fear showed Bevakare's eyes, the fear that he had
failed his people. Worried his people prayed, they prayed to the god of travellers
that he may allow them to start their journey and for once their prayer was answered.
The gate stuttered to life, a connection was made to the other side and the gate
opened to let the people of the Old Lineage through. Soon thousands of people started
filtering through the gate.</p>

<p>The actions of the Old Lineage had alerted the leaders of the
majority that something was up. With food to feed thousands disappearing from the
stores and the sudden look of hope in the eyes of the Old Lineage, the leaders of the
majority set about to learn what was happening. They sent their spies to learn what
was happening and once they returned they sent a force to destroy the gate and prevent
the Old Lineage from fleeing. Just as they arrived they saw Bevakare take one last look
at his workshop and step through the gate. The soldiers of the majority tried to
follow him through the gate, but as the bottom of his robes cleared the archway the
gate shut for the final time. The soldiers found themselves looking at the light
emitted by the gate slowly ebbed away until nothing was left.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on the other side of the gate the Old Lineage started their work
on their new settlement that they decided to name Gransby.</p>

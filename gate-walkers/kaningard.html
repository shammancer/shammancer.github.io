        <p>The collapsed mine. Once one of the largest mines of the Konungariket the
Kaningard was a sprawling maze of tunnels that spanned two races. At the height
of the empire the mine was evacuated due to the fear of its imminent collapse.</p>

<p>A thousand years later the mine is a depression in the planes surrounded by
cliffs seventeen odd feet in the air. Around the depression lies a barren waste
as far as the eye can see. However in the depression sheltered by the cliffs
stands a thriving forest filled with a small variety of animals and plants.
Hidden underneath the canopy of the trees lies the ruins of the overground
structures of the mines. There are collapsed entrances, stockpiles and other
buildings of unknown purpose.</p>

<p>In the centre of the forest there is an oddly large clearing, a meadow in fact 
and in it's centre stands the Kaningard gate. Starting not far from the gate and
continuing on to the edge of the cliffs and even further in the barren planes
are what once were three major roads used to bring materials to and from the gate.
What lies at the end of these roads is unknown.</p>

        <p>The settlement of Gransby is the last of known hold of the forgotten Konungariket.
It was founded during the exile of the last of the Konungan from the city of Grindarnastad.
The current population of Gransby is fifteen hundred people most of which are the original
settlers from Grindarnastad.</p>

<p>The settlement is built around the gate which the Konungan first arrived the
Dorroppning till Sakerhet. The core district of Gransby is surrounded by water
yet it still has access to the land and the rest of the settlement.
The Gransby River generally flows from east to west. The settlement core is built on
the inside of a northern meander and on the southern edge of the core district is
marked by an oxbow lake. The northern meander is one of the largest parts of the river in
the local region thus preventing most crossings to the north. The land crossings
to the main landmass to the south are quite small barely a bowshot wide each. South of
the lake their are small bald hills for quite a few races.</p>

<p>Inside the core district formed by river and the lake is the gate the market and
the administrative buildings of the settlement. There are no residential areas
in the core. It is done so that the residences might be protected by the choke points
that are formed by the crossings as well as the fact that the core is quite prone to
flooding. As a result those that can afford raised houses live closer to the core district
and those that are not live in the hills.</p>

<p>Subsistence for the settlement is provided by rice that is grown in the floodplains of the
river.</p>

<p>The society of Gransby is organized in guilds as was done in the last days of the
Konungariket. The guilds are quite exclusive and unless one has family ties in a guild
it is quite hard to join it. The guilds are quite happy to do business with anybody, however
they will aggressively defend their markets.</p>

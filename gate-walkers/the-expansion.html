        <p>It has been fifteen years since the Exile of the Konungan. In that time the fifteen hundred
people that travelled with Bevakare have managed to settle the area of Gransby. While the
settlement has had it's growing pains the people of Konungan have flourished for the first
time in hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Konungan managed to prepare themselves well and most made it through the
first bitter winter. The winter spared most yet a few young babes did not see the first
spring showers and a few elders missed the joining of their families.</p>

<p>Once the mellow spring came and the celebrations of freedom and new life marked by marriages
concluded, the Konungan turned to starting their new life in earnest. In the first growing
season they managed to have enough stores to last them until the next winter. It seemed
that the planes were quite generous to the Konungan.</p>

<p>As the years progressed the guilds found their place in Gransby. With the prosperity of
Gransby, the guilds quickly grew in power. They whipped the economy into shape and soon
they hungered for new areas to expand their trade.</p>

<p>However, over the last few years Bevakare has not sat idle. As Gransby grew around him
Bevakare continued to study the books that he had brought with him from Grindarnastad.
He believes that he has found references to another plane that has promise. The old
merchant journals that he has been studying seem to hold references to some mines
that the Konungariket controlled.</p>

<p>Bevakare approached the guilds to see if they would be willing to fund an expedition to
find the mine. Many jumped at the opportunity, but they all wished to maintain control
of their investment and keep the other guilds out. In an attempt to cool the contention
between the guilds Bevakare proposed an unconventional idea. It was time for the
reestablishment of an old guild, the Frontier Guild. By keeping the expedition
independent of the existing guilds, Bevakare hoped to receive the support of most of
the guilds. He did manage it however there were always detractors.</p>

<p>The proposal of the reestablishment of the Frontier Guild was a momentous event for
the Konungan as it professes the beginning of a new empire. Once the Frontier Guild
 had been the largest guild in the Konungariket, but it had collapsed with the
empire. The main charter of the Frontier Guild was to explore and survey the planes beyond
the Konungariket. It was the main body that expanded the empire's domain it also was tasked
with establishing first contact with the denizen's of the other planes as well as
scouting during times of war.</p>

<p>With the approval of the guilds Bevakare turned to the population of Gransby for volunteers
to mount the expedition to find the old mines.</p>
